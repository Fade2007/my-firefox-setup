# What is this?

This repo is born just **to have a backup** of the setup I use for my Firefox. 
I don't consider this a "theme" or similiar, I consider this setup an "enchanced firefox": it has some improvements while keeping the default feeling.

### Can I use this?

Well...

_this repo will be actively updated_, but since this is just my "backup" plan so you can do whatever you want with this, however, do it at your own risk.

### "I think this thing could fit/improve your setup and I'd like to let you know, can I pull request/suggest it?"
If you want to suggest me some css things that you think they could improve/fit with this userChrome/Content, go ahead and do a pull request or open a thread in "issues" Both are fine. 
I'm interested in discovering new things.

### Attention please

These are used on W10 20h2, no idea on how they will look in macOS/Linux.
This setup is done for the stable branch of FF.
