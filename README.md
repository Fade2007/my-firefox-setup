# What is this?

This repo is born just **to have a backup** of the setup I use for my Firefox. 
I don't consider this a "theme" or similiar, I consider this setup an "enchanced firefox": it has some improvements while keeping the default feeling.
It's not private just because it's easier for me to look at it.
